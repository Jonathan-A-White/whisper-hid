# Whisper Bluetooth Keyboard

## What this is
Three-component system that turns a Samsung phone into a speech-to-text
Bluetooth keyboard. A PWA provides the UI, a Python+Flask server in Termux
handles mic capture and Whisper transcription, and a headless Kotlin service
sends keystrokes via Bluetooth HID.

## Architecture (SPEC-2)
- Component 1 (PWA): UI + orchestration, hosted on GitHub Pages, saved to homescreen
- Component 2 (Termux): Python+Flask Whisper HTTP server on localhost:9876, owns mic capture
- Component 3 (Kotlin app): Headless BT HID service with HTTP API on localhost:9877
- Communication: HTTP REST APIs between all three components

## Key technical decisions
- BluetoothHidDevice API (Android 9+) — no root needed
- whisper.cpp built natively in Termux (ARM64 NEON)
- HTTP APIs replace the old TCP socket protocol
- PWA hosted on GitHub Pages — UI updates without APK reinstall
- Mic capture stays in Termux (browser can't reliably access BT headset mic)
- Auth token generated per service session, passed via URL from Kotlin app to PWA

## Build
- Android app: `./gradlew assembleDebug` (output: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/)
- PWA: `cd pwa && npm install && npm run build` (output: pwa/dist/)
- Termux scripts: Copy to phone, run setup-termux.sh once
- CI builds APK on push to main, deploys PWA to GitHub Pages on push to main

## Coding conventions
- Kotlin for Android app, Bash for Termux scripts, Python for Whisper server
- TypeScript + React + Tailwind for PWA
- Minimal dependencies — prefer Android SDK built-ins for Kotlin
- No external Kotlin libraries (uses com.sun.net.httpserver for HTTP)
- Shell scripts should be POSIX-compatible where possible but can use bash features

## Testing
- Kotlin: `./gradlew test` — JUnit tests for HidKeyMapper and state machine
- Python: `pytest scripts/tests/` — Whisper server API tests
- PWA: Playwright E2E tests (future)
- Full pipeline: Start Whisper server in Termux, open PWA, speak, verify text on laptop
